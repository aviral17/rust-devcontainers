WE can run mold from anywhere so its better to keep outside of the project files, so I chose the ROOT folder and ran all the commands  and after running all the commands, I created .cargo/config.toml file inside rust  axum-server folder  and then pasted the following --------->

[target.x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu]
linker = "clang"
rustflags = ["-C", "link-arg=-fuse-ld=/path/to/mold"]

where path = absolute path, you can get from using the command which mold inside mold/build folder or anywhere ````````````

---------------- ********************************** -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

For mold installation, I used the following commands from the following github link -------> ðŸ‘‰ https://github.com/rui314/mold#how-to-use

---------------- ********************************** -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

For Clang, use ---------->  

sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install clang


I got problem in installing the last 2 commands of the above mold installation, i.e., my C++ and gcc not updated to version 10 so I used the following commands: ------------>

        If running `sudo apt-get install build-essential` did not update your C++ compiler to a version that supports C++20, you may need to take additional steps to install a more recent version of the compiler.

One way to do this is to add a Personal Package Archive (PPA) that provides more recent versions of the `gcc` and `g++` compilers. A PPA is a repository of software packages that you can add to your system to install software that is not available in the official Ubuntu repositories.

For example, you can add the `ubuntu-toolchain-r/test` PPA to your system by running the following commands:

```
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:ubuntu-toolchain-r/test
sudo apt-get update
```

After adding this PPA, you can install a more recent version of the `gcc` and `g++` compilers by running the `apt-get install` command with the specific version of the compilers that you want to install. For example, to install version 10 of the compilers, you can run the following command:

```
sudo apt-get install gcc-10 g++-10
```

After installing a more recent version of the compilers, you may need to update your system's default C++ compiler to use the new version. You can do this by running the `update-alternatives` command like this:

```
sudo update-alternatives --install /usr/bin/c++ c++ /usr/bin/g++-10 60
```

This command will update your system's default C++ compiler (`c++`) to use version 10 of the `g++` compiler (`/usr/bin/g++-10`). The `60` at the end of the command specifies the priority of this alternative, with higher numbers indicating higher priority.

After updating your system's default C++ compiler, you can check the version of the compiler by running the `c++ --version` command again. If the version of the compiler has been updated to a version that supports C++20, you should be able to build Mold successfully.

I hope this helps clarify how to update your C++ compiler on Ubuntu to a version that supports C++20. Is there anything else you would like to know? ðŸ˜Š
